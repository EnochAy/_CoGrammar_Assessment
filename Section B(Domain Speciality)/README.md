HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists. To predict who will move to a new job.

A company which is active in Big Data and Data Science wants to hire data scientists among people who successfully pass some courses which are conducted by the company. Many people sign up for their training. Company wants to know which of these candidates really wants to work for the company after training or looking for a new employment because it helps to reduce the cost and time as well as the quality of training or planning the courses and categorization of candidates. Information related to demographics, education, experience are in hands from candidates signup and enrollment.
This dataset is designed to understand the factors that lead a person to leave their current job for HR research too. By model(s) that uses the current credentials,demographics,experience data you will predict the probability of a candidate to look for a new job or will work for the company, as well as interpreting affected factors on employee decision.
The whole data is divided to train and test . Target isn't included in the test as this is the variable we are trying to predict.

Problem Definition (Using a What Question): What are the possible factors (features) that could influence a worker's decision to change jobs and work for a company?

Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between the frequency of change of job by data scientists and Development index of their cities, years of experience, educational level, company size, last new job, and training hours.

Inspiration:
Predict the probability of a candidate will work for the company
Interpret model(s) such a way that illustrate which features affect candidate decision


Why will an experienced data scientist decide to change jobs?
Answer: An experienced data scientist desires a new job when the current job isn't paying him/her well enough or the working conditions/environments aren't nice enough.

Why do STEM data scientists easily change jobs?
Why do data scientists that get a new job recently still desire to change jobs?
Why do the training hours of data scientists influence their decision to change jobs or not?
Why does the size of the company affect the decision to change jobs or not for a data scientist?
